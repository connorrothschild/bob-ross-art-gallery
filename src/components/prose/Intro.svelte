    Welcome to the Bob Ross virtual art gallery! We know you've had a <em
      >hard</em
    > year, and you deserve to relax.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully, we've collected 403 paintings that Bob Ross painted during his <strong
      >Joy of Painting</strong
    >
    series. For each of those paintings, we've collected information on how it was
    painted, including <em>which colors each painting used</em>.

    Let's take a brief tour before getting to the gallery!<a
