    Welcome to the Bob Ross virtual art gallery! We know you've had a <em
      >hard</em
    > year, and you deserve to relax.
  </p>
  <p>
    And what better way to relax than Bob Ross? I've collected 403 paintings
    that Bob Ross painted during his <strong>Joy of Painting</strong>
    series and presented them for you here in a virtual art gallery.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each painting, we also have information on how it was painted,
    specifically <em>which colors the painting used</em>. Let's take a brief
    tour of Bob Ross' colors before getting to the gallery!<a
