# archieml.org

This codebase powers the [archieml.org](http://archieml.org) website.

## Archie Markup Language Specification

This repository is also the main discussion form for issues and suggestions on the ArchieML spec. Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/newsdev/archieml.org/issues) page to contribute.

## Tests

A shared codebase of test meant to be used by parsers is available in the `test` directory. During the pre-release development process for version `1.0`, these tests may change as further Candidate Recommendations are proposed, before becoming stable upon the official definition of version `1.0`.

## Parsers

Also check out the two official ArchieML parsers:

* [archieml-js](https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-js) (JavaScript)
* [archieml-ruby](https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-ruby) (Ruby)
